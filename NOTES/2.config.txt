# basic cmd
    $ npm init -y
    $ npm i lite-server
    $ npm start // before add script{ "start": "lite-server" }

# single file compile ts to js
    $ tsc app.ts

# multiple file compile ts to js
    $ tsc  

# create a folder to save all ts to js files
     
     $ tsc -init
    

# exlude in ts.config
    - list files and folder which avoid to compile  

        {

                ....
            },
          "exclude": ["app2.ts"] // this file won't be compile
        }

    # some ex:

        "exclude": ["app.dev.ts"] 
        "exclude": ["*.dev.ts"] // don't compile which last name of file have .dev.ts
        "exclude": ["**/*.dev.ts"] // don't compile of any folder and which last name of file have .dev.ts

        - basic exclude node_modules and dev dependencies files and folders
        - node_modules is default exclude
    

# include

# sourcemap - enable for debug the ts 

# rootDir, outDir
     
    "rootDir": "./src"  // compile all of src files
    "outDir": "./dist"  // store all js files in dist folder

# noEmitOnError: true // not compile any ts file if have any error
                  false // alternative. compile all ts file if have any error
            

#  debuge in chrome
    
    "sourceMap": true   // if is true then chrome inpection can see the compiled
